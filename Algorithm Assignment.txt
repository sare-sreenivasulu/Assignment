//* 1. Armstrong Number   *//

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Assign num=0
Step 3: let us consider a temp variable to store the number
Step 4: Using While condition perform some mathematical Operations like
	temp=number%10;
	number=number/10;
	result=result+(Multiply the number);
Step 5: use if condition to equal the number,if the number equals then it is an Armstrong
Step 6: or else Not an Armstrong Number.




//*  2. Armstrong Number in the range of 100-999   *//


Step 1: Start
Step 2: take Input number from 100 to 1000 in between
Step 3: using for loop condition perform some Calculations.
Step 4: i=100 to i<=999 and initialize num with "i"
Step 5: Declare and Intialize temp = num;
Step 6: by using the for loop condition perform some calculation like 
	rem=num%10;
	num=num/10;
	sum=sum+rem*rem*rem;
Step 7: make the solution equal to the temp;
Step 8: by performing the calculation if sum is equal to the temp,then 
	the number is Armstrong or else it is an not Armstrong.
Step 9: Stop.


//* 3.Compound Interset of Supplied Values   *//

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept the Supplied values (Accept the Principle,rate,time)
Step 3: Calculate SI=(Principle*rate*time)/100;
Step 4: Print SI
Step 5: Calculate CI=Principle*math.pow(1+r*0.01,t)-amount
Step 6: Print CI



//* 4.Marks of 3 Subjects  *//

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Make a Statement to take the input from the user
Step 3: enter the 3 subjects marks 
Step 4: by using the if condition compare the subjects marks
	like s1>60 && s2>60 && s3>60
	else if s1>60 && s2>60 || s1>60 && s3>60 || s2>60 && s3>60 
Step 5: if the condition doesn't match the requirement then student 
	will be passed or failed or will be promoted.
Step 6: Stop the program.



//* 5.Income Tax  *//


Step 1: start
Step 2: Make a Statement to take the input from the user
Step 3: Enter the current ctc 
Step 4: if the current ctc>0 && ctc<=180000 then we no need to 
	pay any taxes.
Step 5: if the current ctc>181001 && ctc<=300000 then we need to 
	pay tax amount of 10%
Step 6:if the current ctc> 300001 && ctc<= 500000 then we need to 
	pay tax amount of 20%
Step 7:if the current ctc> 500001 && ctc<= 1000000 then we need to 
	pay tax amount of 30%
Step 8:Stop


//* 7. Array size of 15 which is sorted or not *//

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept the Array
Step 3: Display the Array
Step 4: Enter the element you want to search in array
Step 5: use for loop for each element
	if arr[index]==key
	then set flag==true
	end for loop
Step 6:if flag == true print that element
Step 7:else Print element not found 


//* 8.Bubble Sort *//


Step 1: Start
Step 2: Insert and accept the array in a container 
Step 3: perform the  for loop calculation like
	int i=0;i<a.lenght-1;i++;
Step 4: to compare the lenght of the array create one 
	more for loop like 
	int j=0;j<a.lenght-i-1;j++;
Step 5: the output of the two loops is stored in temp
	variable.
Step 6: print the output
Step 7: terminate the program. 


//* 6.Login credentials *//
Step 1: Start
Step 2:Accept the username and password
Step 3:if(username.equals(password))
Step 4: Display welcome username
Step 5:else :error!! try again
Step 6:while(c<3)//when the three login attempts failed
Step 7:Display contact admin
Step 8:Terminate the program


//* 9.marks of subjects*//
Step 1:Start
Step 2:accept the three student 
Step 3:accept the three subject marks of each student
Step 4:sum of the individual student marks
Step 5:average of the individual student marks
Step 6:sum of the three student marks of each subject
Step 7:Average of three subject marks of each subject
Step 8:Display the output
Step 9:Treminate the program
